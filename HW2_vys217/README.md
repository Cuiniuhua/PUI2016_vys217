I was working in groups while doing the assignments

# Assignment 1

I completed the assignment by myself.

In this assignment, we get the JSON data from MTA website through the SIRI API. We parse through the JSON data and extra the below info:
the bus name,
the number of vehicles
their current position and display it.

The system arguments (MTA key and Bus no.) are used while running the python script.

Latitude,Longitude, Next Stop Name, Stop Status and write the information in a .CSV file.

# Assignment 3

Achilles Saxby helped me with the plot('df.plot' was unable to display legend, so he suggested to use 'df.plot.scatter'), remaining part was done by me.

In this assignment, we used the dataset from the data facility directly, we used dataframes to manipulate the data and finally plot the numerical columns against each other.
