a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses

The overall idea of looking into the difference in types is nice and there is no problem in the formatting. However, I think

that the test can take factors such as time into account. For instance, he can compare typers in days or daytime v.s. nighttime.

b. Verify that the data supports the project

The data supports the project and address the  features to answer the question.

c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked.

I think that chaisquare-Test can be used to looks at difference between two groups (subscripter/customer).
