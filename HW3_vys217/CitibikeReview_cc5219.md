Hey Vish. 
Thank you for your reminder. 


a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses

You formulated the Null Hypothesis as following: The mean trip duration of single time user (customer) is less than or equal to the mean trip duration of the subscribers.(T(customer) <= T(subscriber)) and Alternate Hypothesis is: The mean trip duration of single time user (customer) is more than the mean trip duration of the subscribers.(T(customer) > T(subscriber))

The overall idea of looking into the difference in types is nice and there is no problem in the formatting. I just have a suggestion that the test can take factors such as time into account. For instance, maybe compare typers in days or daytime v.s. nighttime.


b. Verify that the data supports the project

The data supports the project and address the features to answer the question. 


c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked.

I think chaisquare-Test can be used to looks at difference between two groups (subscripter/customer).

Thanks again and good luck.

Chenxi.
