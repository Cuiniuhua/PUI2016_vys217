# Assignment 1,2 and 3 for Homework 3 

## I worked with Aaron, Priyanshi, Akshay, Achilles, Christian, Anastasiya for this Homework

## Assignment 1: 
### I created 100 samples of sizes between 10 to 2000, and created 5 different distributions of mean '100' from these 100 samples. Plotted the distributions as sample size against sample mean, which is showing that as the sample size is increasing the sample mean is tending towards the population mean(100).

### At the end, I plotted the histogram of the sample means of the 5 distributions together, the resulting distribution was similar to a normal(gaussian) distribution, this is according to the Central Limit Theorem. I plotted a gaussian curve fitting the histogram to visulaize the normal distribution of the sample means.

### I used stackoverflow for the syntax to plot the gaussian curve(pdf) and helped others for this assignment


## Assignment 2:
### The idea for which the hypothesis is formulated and implemented was given by Akshay. Priyanshi, Aaron, Achilles, Akshay, Anastasiya and me used this idea for our Assignment 2.
### Christian helped in the hypothesis formulation.
## The code for downloading the csv file works but may show  "WARNING!!! something is wrong: the file is not there!" - this happens becaus the file is large and takes time to unzip, so even if it shows this message, please wait for sometime and rerun the cell, csv file will be present.
### I did the data wrangling and plotted the graphs and helped others with it. 


## Assignment 3:
### I came up with a Null and Alternative Hypothesis and formulated the same. Using the times.txt data, did the Z-test and proved the Null hypothesis to be wrong. 

### Aaron explained the distribution cencepts of sigma, mu and Achilles explained the Z-test and its meaning.
