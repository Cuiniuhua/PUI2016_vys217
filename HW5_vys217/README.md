# Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
## Experimental setup:  you have a test and a control sample.

# Null Hypothesis: The percentage of fat loss by the people in test group who did diet is less than or equal to the percentage of fat loss by the people in the control group who did exercise
## $H_0 = %(Fat\_loss)_{diet} \leq (Fat\_loss)_{exercise}$



# Do American trust the president?
## POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

# Null Hypothesis: The percentage of people who believed in the honesty and integrity of president 'Bill Clinton' is greater than or equal to the percentage of people who did not believe in the honesty and integrity of president 'Bill Clinton'
## $H_0 = %(Believe) \geq (Don't_\believe)$


# Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
## Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

# Null Hypothesis: The Cessation rate for smokers using nicotine patch is less than or equal to the smokers using the placebo patch
## $H_0 = (Cessation\_rate)_{nicotine} \leq (Cessation\_rate)_{placebo}$




# Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
## Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

# Null Hypothesis: The mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother smoked during pregnancy is greater than the mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy
## $H_0 = Mean(IQ\_at\_different\_ages)_{smoked} > Mean(IQ\_at\_different\_ages)_{not\_smoked}$
