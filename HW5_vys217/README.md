# I worked with Aaron Dsouza, Achilles Saxby, Priyanshi Singh, Anastasia Shegay for this Homework. Dongjhe Fan and Wan Yao helped me during the assignment.

# Assignment 1
## In this assignment, Dongjhe Fan and Wan Yao explained me the concepts of PDF and CDF. 
## In this assignment, I plotted the histogram for the age distribution. Then used the KS and AD tests for the goodness of fit test with the normal, Rayleigh and exponential distributions

# Assignment 2
## I completed the assignment by my own. In this assignment, I cleaned the data(changing the object to float, removing NaN's, etc), then plotted the scatter matrix. Fitted a regression line through the total median income data for different races. Also fitted a line using analytical soln, compared the R^2's of the different lines. Afterwards, considered all the median incomes for all races to fit the regression line. Understood the concept of high leverage and high influence points.(I hope, what I understood is correct!!), I did understand that p-value can be calculated to find the high influential points, but not sure how to do it. Predicted the stipend of females whan we know the stipend of a corresponding male, using the linear regression model. At the end, provided some insights about how the data can be used to analyse the income by different races.

# Assignment 3
## Did the assignment individually and then discussed with my group and made changhes accordingly

# Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
## Experimental setup:  you have a test and a control sample.

# Null Hypothesis: The percentage of fat loss by the people in test group who did diet is less than or equal to the percentage of fat loss by the people in the control group who did exercise
## H0 = %(Fat loss)diet <= (Fat loss)_exercise



# Do American trust the president?
## POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

# Null Hypothesis: The percentage of people who believed in the honesty and integrity of president 'Bill Clinton' is greater than or equal to the percentage of people who did not believe in the honesty and integrity of president 'Bill Clinton'
## H0 = %(Believe) >= (Don't believe)


# Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
## Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

# Null Hypothesis: The Cessation rate for smokers using nicotine patch is less than or equal to the smokers using the placebo patch
## H0 = (Cessation rate)nicotine <= (Cessation rate)placebo




# Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
## Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

# Null Hypothesis: The mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother smoked during pregnancy is greater than the mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy
## H0 = Mean(IQ at different ages)smoked > Mean(IQ at different ages)not-smoked
