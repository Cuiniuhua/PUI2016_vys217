# Working with Data - Computer Lab for Guest Lecture Julia Lane

I worked with Aaron D'souza, Achilles Saxby, Priyanshi Singh, Akshay for this assignment.

In this assignment, 311 call complaints have been analysed for community districts in respect of income and internet and mobile infrastructure.

I completed the data wrangling part of 311 data by myself. For the next two datasets, the group discussed about the indicators that should be considered for the data analysis. Aaron helped me in creating the logic for cleaning the infrastructure data.   

# Plot reviews
I have reveiwed the plots for Avikal and Achilles.
